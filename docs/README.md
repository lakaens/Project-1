## Grandpa's Flip Flop Project 1: Gunsmoke

Gun.Smoke is a vertical scrolling arcade game made by Capcom in 1985. The game is a shooter with Western setting. The objective of the game is to find and catch 10 different criminals along 10 different stages. They will be the Final bosses at the end of every stage. The playable character can find some power ups and items that help to advance in every stage, however, the player has only 2 lives along every stage, and can shoot in 3 different directions (left diagonal, forward, and right diagonal) pushing 3 different buttons. The difficulty of the game is really high due the high quantity of enemies that appear in screen and shoot against the player from all directions, and the low movement speed of the character.
